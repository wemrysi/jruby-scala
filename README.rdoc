= jruby-scala

Scala integration/interop library for JRuby.

Much of the code for this library is originally from an article written by
Daniel Spiewak:

  http://www.codecommit.com/blog/ruby/integrating-scala-into-jruby

many thanks to Daniel for his great article and implementation.

== Usage

You'll need to make sure JRuby loads the scala-library jar before this gem is loaded.  You can do this two ways:

1. Specifying the Jar via classpath when executing JRuby
    jruby -J-cp path/to/scala-library-VERSION.jar some-ruby-script-which-uses-jruby-scala.rb

2. Requiring the Scala jar before the gem in your .rb file
    require 'path/to/scala-library-VERSION.jar'
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'jruby_scala'

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
